# Card Battler

This is my first attempt at developing a game using the Kaboom.js library. I put this together to demonstrate writing code during a Cub Scout meeting for my son. This project was in fulfillment of the Nova/STEM award called Cub Scouts Can Code. It is very much a work-in-progress.

## Running the Game

Running this game locally requires Node.js version 20 or greater. Download Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
Once Node.js is installed, you can open up a terminal at the root of this project and run `npm install`. Once the dependencies are installed, run `npm run dev` to build the game and start the webserver. Navigate to the url it shows (localhost at some port like 5173) to play the game.
